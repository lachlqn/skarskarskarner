                <h2>The Three Pillars of Web Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern web development is built on three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each serves a specific purpose in creating web pages and applications.
                </p>
                
                <h2>HTML: The Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every website. It provides the structure and content of web pages. Think of HTML as the skeleton of your website - it defines what elements are present and how they're organized.
                </p>
                
                <h2>CSS: The Styling</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation of your website. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. CSS transforms plain HTML into beautiful, professional-looking websites.
                </p>
                
                <h2>JavaScript: The Interactivity</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript adds dynamic behavior to websites. It handles user interactions, form validation, animations, and much more. JavaScript is what makes websites feel responsive and engaging.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to learn web development is by doing. Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity. Build a personal portfolio, create a blog, or develop a simple web application. The key is consistent practice and experimentation.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Take your time, be patient with yourself, and enjoy the learning process. The web development community is vast and supportive, so don't hesitate to seek help when needed.
