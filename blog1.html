                    One of the highest upside things you can do is reach out to people who are: 1. in the position that you want to be in 2. can help you get there, or 3. are on the same journey you are. This applies to founders, angel investors, recruiters, execs and ayone in between. But how do you reach these people?

                <h2>The Three Pillars of Web Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern web development is built on three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each serves a specific purpose in creating web pages and applications.
                </p>
                
                <h2>HTML: The Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every website. It provides the structure and content of web pages. Think of HTML as the skeleton of your website - it defines what elements are present and how they're organized.
                </p>
                
                <h2>CSS: The Styling</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation of your website. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. CSS transforms plain HTML into beautiful, professional-looking websites.
                </p>
                
                <h2>JavaScript: The Interactivity</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript adds dynamic behavior to websites. It handles user interactions, form validation, animations, and much more. JavaScript is what makes websites feel responsive and engaging.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to learn web development is by doing. Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity. Build a personal portfolio, create a blog, or develop a simple web application. The key is consistent practice and experimentation.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Take your time, be patient with yourself, and enjoy the learning process. The web development community is vast and supportive, so don't hesitate to seek help when needed.
